# Elevator simulator

This is an elevator simulator written in Java 19. It features a multi-window GUI and a control system to emulate multiple elevators. A user acts as a 'summoner' of passengers by making calls on different floors, picking destinations and putting an elevator to motion.

It was developed as a coursework for an Object-oriented Programming course in ETU.
